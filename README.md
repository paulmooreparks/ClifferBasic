# ClifferBasic
ClifferBasic is a sample program for the Cliffer CLI library that implements a very simple BASIC interpreter environment as a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). This project demonstrates the usage of the Cliffer CLI library to build a custom command-line application with an interactive BASIC-like language interpreter.
